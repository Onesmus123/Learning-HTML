        <h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
        <p>There are two display values: <b>block</b> and <b>inline</b>.</p>
        
        <h1>1. Block-level Elements.</h1>
        
        <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.</p>
        <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
        
        <h5>Example:</h5>
        
        <p style="border:1px black solid;">Hello World.</p>
        <div style="border: 1px black solid;">Hello World.</div>
        <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
        
        <h2>The div element:</h2>
        
        <p>The <strong>div</strong> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.</p>
        <p>When used together with CSS, the <strong>div</strong> element can be used to style blocks of content.</p>
        
        <h5>Example:</h5>
        
        <div style="color:white; background-color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.7); font-size: 20px; padding:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">

        </div>
        
        <h1>2. Inline Elements.</h1>
        
        <p>An inline element does not start on a new line.</p>
        <p>An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
        
        <h3>The span element:</h3>
        <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
        
        <h5>Example:</h5>
        <p>I am <span style="border:1px solid black;">Onesmus Mutyauvyu</span>, a skilled programmer and web developer.</p>
        <p>I am <span style="color:red; ">tall</span>, <span style="color:green">dark</span> and <span style="color:blue;">handsome</span>.</p>
