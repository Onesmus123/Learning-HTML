        <h1>HTML Quotation and Citation Elements</h1>
        
        <h2>HTML blockquote for Quotations</h2>
        
        <p>The HTML <strong>blockquote</strong> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.</p>
        
        <p>Browsers usually <mark>indent</mark> <strong>blockquote</strong> elements.</p>
        
        <h5>Example:</h5>
        
        <p>Here is a quote from GoodReads:</p>
        
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com">
        I believe that we have reached a stage in life in the economic development of Africa where moving forward is perilous, moving backwards is cowardice and standing still is suicidal but we must persevere because winners do not quit and quitter never win ― PLO Lumumba
        </blockquote>

        <h2>HTML q for Short Quotations</h2>

        <p>The HTML <strong>q</strong> tag defines a short quotation.</p>

        <p>Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <p>My goal is to: <q>Become a Software Engineer</q>.</p>

        <h2>HTML abbr for Abbreviations</h2>

        <p>The HTML <strong>abbr</strong> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".</p>

        <p>Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.</p>

        <p><b>Tip:</b> Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <p>The <abbr title="United Democratic Alliance">UDA</abbr> is the leading political party in Kenya.</p>

        <h2>HTML address for Contact Information</h2>

        <p>The HTML <strong>address</strong> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.</p>

        <p>The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.</p>

        <p>The text in the <strong>address</strong> element usually renders in <mark>italic</mark>, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <strong>address</strong> element.</p>

        <address>
            Written by Onesmus Mutyauvyu.<br>
            Email: mutyauvyudavid@gmail.com</br>
            Box 746-00100<br>
            KENYA
        </address>

        <h2>HTML cite for Work Title</h2>

        <p>The HTML <strong>cite</strong> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b> A person's name is not the title of a work.</p>

        <p>The text in the <strong>cite</strong> element usually renders in <mark>italic</mark>.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <p><cite>My Life in Crime</cite> is a 1984 novel by Kenyan author John Kiriamiti.</p>

        <h2>HTML bdo for Bi-Directional Override</h2>

        <p>BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.</p>

        <p>The HTML <strong>bdo</strong> tag is used to override the current text direction.</p>

        <p>If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), the next line will be written from right to left (rtl).</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <bdo dir="rtl">I am Onesmus Mutyauvyu </bdo>

    </body>
